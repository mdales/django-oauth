This is a forked version of David Larlet's django-oauth.

One very important difference is that this version requires that you be running a real cache behind Django's caching framework: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/

The cache is used for keeping track of nonces and making sure that none are duplicated within a short period of time, so a cache backend with automatic expiry is required. Memcached is known to work, other backends are untested.

If you run with a dummy cache, django-oauth will operate without complaint, but you will lose all protection against replay attacks. You should only do this in testing environments.

Also there are a couple of backward-incompatible changes from the upstream version.

* This version has a different db schema - additional fields on the Token model.

* This version changes the signature of the OAUTH_CALLBACK_VIEW callable
